Tip Calculator
========

This is a simple Tip Calculator. The user inputs the bill amount and selects the tip percentage (10%, 15%, 20%) and it outputs the total amount. There is an additional settings page which allows the user to set the default value for the tip. This value is over-ridden once the user selets a new percentage in the main app page.


Finished the project in about 5-6 hours.

Note: Faced some issues with the UISegmentedView on the Settings page where it wouldn't allow me to select any value. Resolved it by deleting the segment and creating a new one. Still unsure about the root cause
